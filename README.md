So you have some sexy component cables on your big widescreen TV and you think you are ballin' hard?
Well sorry to break it to you but you aren't.
Most games do not have widescreen support so they just stretch the image.
Some games have widescreen options but they aren't always a proper widescreen.

These cheats will give you the best experience!

Just make sure you go to "Cheat Settings" and change "Enable PS2RD Cheat Engine" to "On" and change "PS2RD Cheat Engine Mode" to "Auto-select cheats".

This doesn't have every single game, and they haven't all been tested, but I am working on it. 

I am converting the .pnach files from this Widescreen patch archive:
